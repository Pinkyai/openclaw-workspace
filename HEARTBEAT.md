# HEARTBEAT.md

# Keep this file empty (or with only comments) to skip heartbeat API calls.

# Add tasks below when you want the agent to check something periodically.

## Basic checks (rotate through these 2-4 times per day):
- Check workspace for new files or changes
- Review recent memory entries for important updates
- Check if Sebastian mentioned any upcoming events or deadlines
