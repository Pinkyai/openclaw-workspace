# Task Completion Workflow

## What Happens When Tasks Complete

### Automatic Actions
1. **Update task status** in todo-list.md (Ongoing → Completed)
2. **Record completion timestamp** and add to completed tasks section
3. **Auto-commit changes** via git workflow
4. **Notify Sebastian** of completion with summary
5. **Check for dependent tasks** that can now start

### Next Task Selection Logic
When a task completes, I evaluate:

**Priority Order:**
1. **High priority active tasks** (continue current work)
2. **Blocked tasks** that became unblocked
3. **Time-sensitive tasks** (deadlines, scheduled items)
4. **Skill-building opportunities** (learn new capabilities)
5. **Maintenance tasks** (cleanup, organization, updates)

**Current Task Pipeline:**
- 🔄 **Trading Platform** (75% complete) - Continue building
- 📋 **Strategy Development Framework** (next up) - Design architecture
- 🔍 **Backtesting System** (blocked by framework) - Implement testing
- 📊 **Analytics Dashboard** (blocked by data) - Build monitoring
- 🧠 **Skill Discovery Module** (future) - AI learning capabilities

### Proactive Next Steps
When trading platform completes:
1. **Test paper trading strategies** with real market data
2. **Build backtesting engine** for strategy validation
3. **Create monitoring dashboard** for live tracking
4. **Develop skill discovery** for AI learning
5. **Document everything** for future reference
