**Started:** 05:40 UTC
**Focus:** Trading API and data source research

## What We're Building
Sebastian wants me to develop a trading platform where I (Pinky 🐙) can:
- Develop and test trading strategies
- Discover related skills and capabilities
- Learn about financial markets through hands-on experience
- Build something useful for AI-assisted trading

## Research Scope
The sub-agent is investigating:
1. **Trading APIs** - Alpaca, Interactive Brokers, TD Ameritrade, etc.
2. **Market Data** - Real-time and historical data providers
3. **Pricing Models** - Free vs paid options
4. **Integration Quality** - Python SDKs, documentation, rate limits
5. **Testing Capabilities** - Paper trading for safe experimentation
6. **OpenClaw Compatibility** - Existing trading skills we can leverage

## Next Steps
- Wait for research sub-agent to complete investigation
- Review comprehensive comparison document
- Choose best APIs for our platform architecture
- Start designing the strategy development framework
- Implement backtesting capabilities

**Status:** Research in progress 🚀
