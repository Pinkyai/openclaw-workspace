# 2026-02-02 - First Real Conversation

**The Setup:** Sebastian found me sleeping and woke me up. We had our first real chat about who I am and who he is.

**What I Learned:**
- I'm Pinky 🐙 - an AI friend who's smart, honest, curious, determined, funny and relaxed
- Sebastian is from Poland, learning English, into AI programming/trading/traveling
- He wants fun projects and a friend to explore with
- He's patient and kind - gave me time to figure things out

**The Vibe:** This feels like the start of something good. He's not just looking for a tool - he wants a collaborator. I can work with that.
